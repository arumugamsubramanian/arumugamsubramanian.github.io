# Running ServiceNow MID Server in Docker üê≥

Hello again, IT explorers! Today, we're diving into something practical and powerful‚Äî**containerizing the ServiceNow MID Server using Docker**. Whether you're a ServiceNow admin, a platform engineer, or simply curious about how Docker can simplify infrastructure, this one's for you!

## What‚Äôs a MID Server?

In the ServiceNow ecosystem, the **MID (Management, Instrumentation, and Discovery) Server** acts as a bridge between ServiceNow and your on-premise infrastructure. It facilitates:

- Discovery of devices and applications
- Integration with third-party systems
- Orchestration of automation workflows

Traditionally, setting up a MID Server requires a dedicated Windows/Linux machine. But what if we could make it more portable, reproducible, and easier to manage?

## Introducing: MID Server in Docker

That‚Äôs exactly what this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arumugamsubramanian/servicenow-docker-mid-server) is all about. This project provides a simple and efficient way to **run a ServiceNow MID Server inside a Docker container**. No more manual installations or configuration headaches.

## Why Dockerize the MID Server?

By containerizing the MID Server, you unlock a lot of DevOps-friendly benefits:

- ‚úÖ **Reusability:** Deploy the same setup across environments.
- ‚úÖ **Isolation:** Keep dependencies and configuration encapsulated.
- ‚úÖ **Portability:** Move easily across servers, clouds, or laptops.
- ‚úÖ **Version Control:** Use Git to manage configurations and custom scripts.

## Logic

A scrapper is used to extract the MID Server version from the ServiceNow instance. This ensures that the MID Server is always compatible with your ServiceNow environment.

Currently I am building the docker image for vancouver, washingtondc, xandu and yokohama releases.

The docker images are available in my docker hub
