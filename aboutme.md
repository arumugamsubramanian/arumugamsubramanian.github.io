  <p>My open-source projects started as a fun hobby, but as my tools and content got more popular, it has turned into a full-time job commitment (often taking up 20-40 hours per week). Except with 0 pay and no employer benefits :) My goal is to be able to focus as much as I can on <strong>open-source work that benefits the entire community</strong> rather than individual clients, and I can only reach that goal by getting supported for my hard work.</p>
